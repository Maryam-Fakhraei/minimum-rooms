# minimum-rooms
This is a Python program that reads a class schedule from a file and determines the minimum number of rooms needed to hold classes at any given hour of the day. It also plots a line graph of the number of classes required in every hour of the day.

## Usage: 
1. Put the class schedule in "class_schedule.txt" file with the following format:
<class1_start_time>..<class1_end_time>
<class2_start_time>..<class2_end_time>
<class3_start_time>..<class3_end_time>
...
(There is an example inside the "class_schedule.txt" file)
2. Then run main file 
3. You can see the minimum number of rooms needed to hold classes and a line graph of the number of classes
